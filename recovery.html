            <p>Recovery is a characters ability to make it back to the stage, when knocked away. This can be any combination of using  up special, side special, air dodging, or other moves that could be character specific. Each character has multiple ways to use these options to return to the battlefield.</p>
            <h2>Up Special</h2>
            <p>Up special is perhaps the most common recovery move associated with each character. It usually is a move that gives the character extra height to help them reach the stage.</p>
            <h2>Side Special</h2>
            <p>Some characters may have a side special that is used to help them reach the stage as well. Side specials usually help the character recover  horizontally,  which can mixup recovery options on the opponent.</p>
            <h2>Air Dodging</h2>
            <p>Air dodging gives a character temporary intangibility in the air and allows them angle the dodge as well, allowing them to gain some distance in the process. However, air dodging does put the character into a free fall animation, which does not allow them to do any moves until landing on stage or grabbing the ledge.</p>
