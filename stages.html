            <p>Currently, there are 6 stages that are used in competitive play. Each stage has diferent layouts and blastzone radii, which could give different advantages or disadvantages for certain characters.</p>
            <h2>Starter Stages</h2>
            <p>Starter stages are stages that available to pick throughout the entire set, if not banned by the players. The current starter stages are: Yoshi's Story, Fountain of Dreams, Battlefield, Final Destination, and Dreamland 64.</p>
            <h2>Counterpick Stages</h2>
            <p>Counterpick stages are available to pick after the first game of the set. This is usually due to the stages having a gimmick that does not effect gameplay greatly. The only counterpick stage is Pokemon Stadium (Stage transforms into 4 different layouts)</p>
            <h2>Banned Stages</h2>
            <p>Banned stages are not available to pick throughout the set. This is due to the stages having intrusive stage hazard that interfere with the gameplay between the players, lowering the skill required. The banned stages are any stage that is not a starter or counterpick stage.</p>
